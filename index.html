    <h2>Say No To Junk Food</h2>
    <p>     Nowadays, more and more attention has been paid to food safety and health. As far as I am concerned(就
        我而言), we should say no to junk food.
            There is no doubt that junk food is delicious and attractive, but it surely does harm to our body. Meanwhile,
        over-packaging leads to much more rubbish.（过多包装会导致更多的垃圾产生）
            To get away from junk food, we should focus on how to keep a healthy lifestyle. There are many tips to
        follow. First, eat regularly—three meals a day on time. We should take in as few snacks and fast food as
        possible. Second, it is necessary to have more fruits and vegetables which/that can provide the nutrition 营养
        we need（定从）. Last but not least, do more outdoor activities. It’s well known that more exercise you do, the
        better physical health 身体健康 you will have.
            In a word, a healthy diet with less junk food can help make us healthier and stronger.</p>
